### ASCII to the rescue

The primary goal of this project is to be fun and easy to contribute. In order to simplify development, there are no graphical assests. Using ASCII art only, makes it simple for anyone to add content and has the added bonus of capturing the nostalgic feel of the early classic text based roguelikes.

### Project requirements

* We recommend using Visual Studio 2017 Community for development 
* Windows Vista/7/8/10
